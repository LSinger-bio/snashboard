SNASHBOARD: The Snail Dashboard

 

Snashboard is an interactive data visualization tool that combines citizen science research grade observations with geolocation of discovered gastropod fossils, made by Lulu Singer, Jack Zhu and Jill Hakim. It uses data from iNatrualist (https://www.inaturalist.org/) and the paleobiology database (https://paleobiodb.org/) to produce an interface that primarily builds upon the concept of a "snails near you" button as well as the entertaining titular portmanteau. 

This repo contains the files for the lightweight version of snashboard hosted at https://lsinger-bio.shinyapps.io/snashboard/ , which does not include shape files for the maps for now. If you would like to experience the full functionality of snashboard locally, you can download the app.R + ne folder and uncomment the code for adding shape files to the inaturalist and pbdb maps. Please note that things may take a while to load in this case!
