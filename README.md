SNASHBOARD: The Snail Dashboard

 

Snashboard is an interactive data visualization tool that combines citizen science research grade observations with geolocation of discovered gastropod fossils, made by Lulu Singer, Jack Zhu and Jill Hakim. It uses data from iNatrualist (https://www.inaturalist.org/) and the paleobiology database (https://paleobiodb.org/) to produce an interface that primarily builds upon the concept of a "snails near you" button as well as the entertaining titular portmanteau.
